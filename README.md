## Midterm assignment for IGME 206

Write a short RPG with the following specifications:
*	User prompted commands with enough error checking to ensure that basic mistakes are handled.
  For example, you’d welcome the user, describe an interaction with a particular enemy, give an
  opportunity to respond (e.g. attack or defend), report the loss of hit points, and repeat. You
  don’t have to be as a visual like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSalCI38KHI. 
*	Inheritance with a tree at least two levels deep and two branches wide, e.g., Hero and Enemy as
  an Interface with multiple implementations. And yes, Interfaces count. The total number of classes
  and/or interfaces comes to three. It’s an exam, lest you could be far more interesting.
*	Keep it basic (see output above). You could go even crazier and procedurally generate rooms/areas.
  Assuming you’re reading the whole test and hit Google, you might have found http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/C_Sharp. 
*	The game needs enough balance that it goes a few turns and has a clear end. I can’t promise I
  will do everything possible, and if there’s something special, make it happen very early in the gameplay.
